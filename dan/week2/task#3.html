                <h4>Downstairs</h4>
                <h5>Lyrics</h5>
                <p>You can have all I've made and all I've ever known <br>
You can have both my lungs if you ask me so<br>
'Cause I-I-I want to be the one after your own heart<br>
And I-I-I might doubt the process like I doubted the start<br>
<br><br>
So I'm beggin', oh-oh-oh, mercy<br>
I'm beggin', oh-oh-oh, mercy<br>
<br><br>
Downstairs, I feel better in the cellar<br>
Down there, it's some shelter from the weather<br>
I wear all of my heart on my sleeve<br>
I'll take what I believe, and I'm hiding it<br>
Downstairs, I feel better in the cellar<br>
Down there, it's some shelter from the weather<br>
I wear all of my heart on my sleeve<br>
I'll take what I believe, and I'm hiding it<br>
<br><br>
Feeling like I'm nothing, feeling like I'm run down<br>
Was afraid of nothing, now I'm just ashamed how<br>
I hide my face from you<br>
<br><br>
So I'm beggin', oh-oh-oh, mercy<br>
I'm beggin', oh-oh-oh, mercy<br>
<br><br>
Downstairs, I feel better in the cellar<br>
Down there, it's some shelter from the weather<br>
I wear all of my heart on my sleeve<br>
I'll take what I believe, and I'm hiding it<br>
Downstairs, I feel better in the cellar<br>
Down there, it's some shelter from the weather<br>
I wear all of my heart on my sleeve<br>
I'll take what I believe, and I'm hiding it<br>
<br><br>
Oh, what have I become?<br>
Dirty and wretched one<br>
Am I unholy land?<br>
Have I forced your hand?<br>
<br><br>
Oh, woah-oh, woah-oh, mercy, yeah<br>
Oh, woah-oh, woah-oh, mercy, yeah<br>
<br><br>
Down there, it's some shelter from the weather<br>
I wear all of my heart on my sleeve<br>
I'll take what I believe, and I'm hiding it<br>
Downstairs, I feel better in the cellar<br>
Down there, it's some shelter from the weather<br>
I wear all of my heart on my sleeve<br>
I'll take what I believe, and I'm hiding it<br>
Downstairs (You can have), I feel better in the cellar (All I've made)<br>
Down there, it's some shelter from the weather (All I've ever known)<br>
I wear (You can have) all of my heart on my sleeve (Both my lungs)<br>
I'll take what I believe, and I'm hiding it, yeah (If you ask me so, oh)<br>
<br><br>
And I'm hiding it, yeah ('Cause I want to be the one)<br>
And I'm hiding it, yeah (After your own heart)<br>
And I'm hiding it, yeah, oh (And I might doubt the process like I doubt the start)<br>
<br><br>
You can have all I've made and all I've ever known<br>
You can have both my lungs if you ask me so<br>
'Cause I want to be the one after your own heart<br>
And I might doubt the process like I doubt the start<br>
